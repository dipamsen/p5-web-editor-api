# p5 Web Editor API

<!-- This README file has been partly generated by GitHub Copilot. -->

This node CLI uses the internal p5.js Web Editor API to log in and edit sketches.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. Run the CLI: `node .`

3. Log in with your p5.js Web Editor credentials and select a sketch to edit.

_Recommended: First, create a new sketch in the p5 Web Editor for testing purposes. Then, run the CLI and edit the sketch._

> (Optional) Create a `.env` file with the following contents to avoid having to enter your username and password every time you run the CLI:
>
> ```env
> P5_USERNAME=your_username
> P5_PASSWORD=your_password
> ```
